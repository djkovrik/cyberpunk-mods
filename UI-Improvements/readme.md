# flib's UI Improvements

A collection of quality of life UI improvements to fix minor issues that annoyed me.

### Inventory

 - Iconic Items cannot be disassembled

### Crafting

 - Ammo crafting is limited to the maximum carryable per type

### Journal

 - Sorting messages by timestamp

### Dialer Menu

 - Sorting by either name or timestamp
 - Always shows contacts that are Quest Related or have unread messages first

### Vendors:

 - Iconic Items cannot be sold
 - Ripperdoc vendor screen only shows number of unowned mods in totals

## TODO

- [X] Limit ammo crafting
- [ ] Sort menus
  - Steal sorting widget from other controllers
- [ ] Show scope type
  - Looks like that information is stored in the TweakDB
- [ ] Add search to shards/messages
- [ ] Fix HMG Mods

## Compatability

- Incompatible with my previous mod [Stop Accidentally Disassembling Iconics](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2252) as it implements the same features
