# Stop Accidentally Disassembling Iconics

Ever been chopping your loot to bits and accidentally disassembled an iconic weapon? Well no more!

This mod is available in two variants:

### IconicItems-PreventDisassembly
> Completely removes the ability to disassemble iconic items

### IconicItems-ShowWarningDialog
> Shows a warning dialog to confirm if you want to disassemble an iconic item.<br />
> _(The dialog existed in the backpack, but not in the inventory, because they're implemented completely separately for some insane reason)_

Additionally, I've added another script that can be installed alongside either variant:

### IconicItems-PreventSelling
> Completely removes the ability to sell iconic items


## Installation

Requires the [redscript compiler](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1511) to function. Tested with Cyberpunk Patch 1.2

The zip files are set up to be installed automagically with Vortex or other mod managers, but if you insist on installing it manually then:
- Ensure you have already installed the [redscript compiler](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1511)
- Extract the .zip file of your preferred variant to the Cyberpunk game folder so that the script file ends up in the \r6\scripts folder:<br />
  `Cyberpunk2077\r6\scripts\IconicItems-{variant}.reds`
