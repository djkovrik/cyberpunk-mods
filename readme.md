## Stuff I want to look in to

- [ ] Fixing HMG weapon mods
- [ ] Steal the AR driving directions from Panam's questline and add them to regular driving nav
- [ ] Extract fonts used in-game and generate a list of supported glyphs
- [ ] Add redscript support for casting `array<ref<*>>` to `array<Variant>`
- [ ] Add redscript support for closures
